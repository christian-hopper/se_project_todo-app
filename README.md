# Simple Todo App

The **Simple Todo App** is a clean and functional to-do list application built with vanilla JavaScript and modern best practices. It allows users to add, validate, track, and delete tasks with ease. This project is great for demonstrating modular code structure, DOM manipulation, and basic client-side form validation.
